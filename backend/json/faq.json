        "question": "Are we forever locked down inside the room if we can't find a way out?",
        "answer": "No! All our escape rooms are equipped with emergency exit buttons. If you need to excuse yourself to the bathroom or need to leave the room, you should radio the Game Master to let them know your intentions, so they can respond accordingly. Although you're free to go at any time, we do encourage all players to visit the bathroom beforehand, to ensure everyone's game play and immersion in the game is not disrupted."
